# term_extract - Term Extract


## Description:

term_extract extracts proper nouns (named things like 'Manchester United') and ordinary nouns (like 'event') from text documents.


## Install:

    gem install term-extract

or with bundler:

    #Gemfile:
    gem 'term-extract'
    
## Usage:

An example extracting terms from a piece of content:

    require 'term_extract'

    content = <<DOC
    Business Secretary Vince Cable will stay in cabinet despite
    "declaring war" on Rupert Murdoch, says Downing Street.
    DOC

    terms = TermExtract.extract(content)

## Options

The #extract method takes an (optional) options hash, that allows the term extractor behaviour to be modified.  The following options are available:

* min_occurance - The minimum number of times a single word term must occur to be included in the results, default 3
* min_terms - Always include multiword terms that comprise more than @min_terms words, default 2
* types - Extract proper nouns (:nnp) or nouns (:nn) or both (:all), default :all
* include_tags - Include the extracted POS tags in the results, default false
* collapse_terms - Remove shorter terms that are part of larger ones, default true

Sample usage:

    terms = TermExtract.extract(content, :types => :nnp, :include_tags => true)

## Term Extraction Types

By default, the term extractor attempts to extract both ordinary nouns and proper nouns, this behaviour can be configured using the #types option and specifying :all (for both), :nn (for ordinary nouns) or :nnp (for proper nouns).  These codes correspond to the relevent POS tags used during the term extraction process.  Sample usage is shown below:

    terms = TermExtract.extract(content, :types => :nnp)

## Command Line Tool

There is a command line tool that can be used for testing the term extractor.  It is best used in conjunction with another tool to extract the relevent content (e.g. pismo) :

    pismo http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12085506 body | ruby -rubygems -e 'puts YAML.parse($stdin.read)[:body].value' | ./term-extract nnp | ruby -rubygems -e 'puts YAML.load($stdin.read)'

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile, version, or history as it's handled by Jeweler.
* Send me a pull request. I may or may not accept it.
